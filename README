System Requirements
-------------------
 - Some Unix flavour: Linux, MacOS, cygwin
 - g++
 - libcurses

Installation
------------
1. Create a directory named 'battleship' at some appropriate location on your computer. Let's call this directory BATTLEHOME.
2. Download the following directory into BATTLEHOME.
 - src/
3. Create a directory 'bin' in BATTLEHOME.
4. cd src
5. make

Installation of NCurses
-----------------------
The application depends on the GNU NCurses library. In case your distribution doesn't have it already, you could install it using either of the following two ways:
  1. Build from Source
  --------------------
  - Visit the following: http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/
    and download the latest stable version of NCurses. (I downloaded ncurses-5.9 which is the latest as on this date.)
  - Follow the instructions in the package to build and install the library.

  2. Prebuilt binary
  ------------------
  - Assuming that you are on a Ubuntu/Debian Linux running on a 64-bit system, the following command should get you the desired binary:
  sudo apt-get install lib64ncurses5.
  - For other types of systems, please refer to relevant documentation.

Use
---
Start at BATTLEHOME.
1. cd bin
2. ./battleship

It should work!
